# About this project
### Senario: 
A space ship, USS Enterprise, is out in the space looking for a planet with a top-value mineral, Krypton, to mine. There are a lot of planets that have Krypton, each with a different amount. The USS Enterprise wants to find the planet with the highest amount of Krypton they can find based on the signals they receive on their detector. The signal strength is a combination(function) of two factors(variables): 1, distance between the ship and the planet, and 2, the amount of the mineral on the planet. A shorter distance, a larger amount or both will result in a stronger signal. 

### Method:
// TO BE CONTINUED...

### Result: 
The algorithm will return a XYZ coordinate of the target planet.
