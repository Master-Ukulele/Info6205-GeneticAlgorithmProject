# About this project
### Senario: 
Spaceships, like USS Enterprise, are out in the space looking for a planet with a top-value mineral, Krypton, to mine. There are many planets that have Krypton, each with a different amount. The ships wants to find the planet with the highest amount of Krypton based on the signals they receive on their detector. The signal strength is a combination(function) of two factors(variables): 1, distance between the ship and the planet, and 2, the amount of the mineral on the planet. A shorter distance, a larger amount of mineral or both will result in a stronger signal. The only clue they have is the signal strength so they don't have a lot to start with, but here they are. 

### Result: 
The algorithm returns a XYZ coordinate of the target planet. Also, the planet rank (in size) can be displayed to evaluate the accuracy of the result.
